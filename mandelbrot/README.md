# mandelbrot
This repository contains an [ISPC](https://ispc.github.io/index.html) implementation of the <i>Mandelbrot</i> set fractal [1], based on [Inigo Quilez's distance estimation](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lsX3W4) [2].

This implementation is part of a series of shaders that have been converted from HLSL/GLSL to ISPC using my [HLSL-to-ISPC helper library](https://github.com/zigguratvertigo/hlsl-to-ispc) [3].

<i>Note: The ISPC examples contain an [implementation of the Mandelbrot set](https://ispc.github.io/example.html), though Inigo Quilez's distance-based approach undeniably looks better.</i>

# ISPC
<i>ispc is a compiler for a variant of the C programming language, with extensions for "single program, multiple data" (SPMD) programming. Under the SPMD model, the programmer writes a program that generally appears to be a regular serial program, though the execution model is actually that a number of program instances execute in parallel on the hardware.</i> [4]

# Performance
<i>TODO: Add ISPC vs serial performance numbers here.</i>

# Running
To run the sample, simply execute the provided binary. You can also recompile it via _hlsl-to-ispc.sln_.
